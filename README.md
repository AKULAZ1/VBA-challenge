# VBA-challenge
The piece of code that returns a number in a percentage format to two decimal places- Lns 43, 84, 96- was sourced from a StackOverflow Question Board, which can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38830864/format-to-percent-with-10-or-a-lot-of-decimals-in-vba).

The "Workbook.Worksheets" was sourced from the following [link] (https://powerspreadsheets.com/excel-vba-sheets-worksheets/).
It was an property I found during my self-study when I was wondering what to do if you are not sure how many worksheets are in the workbook or if you want the code to run on newly added worksheets.
